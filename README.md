# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Ratings Analytics Dashboard  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes audience behavior and movie popularity using the **kaggle moviedatasets**.  
The goal was to build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that reveals patterns in ratings, genres, and audience perception.  

By combining Power Query for cleaning, DAX for calculations, and Power BI for visualization, this project transforms raw data into meaningful insights that can support decision-making in media and entertainment.
